# DAO-AI-Future

This project is a website designed to present research on "The Symbiosis of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and AI Agents." The content is based on the research paper found in `DAO-AI-future.txt` and aims for an ultra-modern design with a highly user-friendly interface.

The website is structured as a single-page scrolling site, allowing users to seamlessly navigate through the various sections of the research. It incorporates contemporary design trends such as card-based layouts for structured information and subtle visual effects to enhance user experience.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

To deploy this website using GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure all files are in the root of the `main` branch:**
    *   `index.html`
    *   `style.css`
    *   `script.js`
    *   Any assets, including the hero background image (e.g., `placeholder-hero-bg.jpg` or your chosen image).

2.  **Navigate to Repository Settings:**
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Click on the "Settings" tab.

3.  **Go to the "Pages" Section:**
    *   In the left sidebar, find and click on "Pages" under the "Code and automation" section.

4.  **Configure Build and Deployment:**
    *   Under "Build and deployment":
        *   For "Source," select "Deploy from a branch."
        *   For "Branch," choose `main` (or your default branch) and select `/ (root)` as the folder.
    *   Click "Save."

5.  **Access Your Site:**
    *   GitHub will build and deploy your site. This might take a few minutes.
    *   Once deployed, GitHub will provide you with the URL where your site is live (e.g., `https://<your-username>.github.io/DAO-AI-Future/`).

No special build steps are required as this is a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website.

## Notes

*   **Hero Background Image:** Remember to replace the `placeholder-hero-bg.jpg` referenced in `style.css` with your actual desired hero background image. Ensure the image file is placed in the root of the repository and its filename matches the one specified in the CSS.
*   **Content Population:** The `index.html` file is designed to be populated with the content from `DAO-AI-future.txt`. The current version has this content integrated.
*   **Design Brief:** For more details on the design philosophy, color palette, and typography, refer to `design_brief.md`.
